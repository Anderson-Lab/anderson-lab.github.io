For our competition and for the grading, we will be using R and [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com). We'll dig deeper into R fundamentals in a little bit. The purpose of this assignment is to get you used to working in R and R Markdown. For a quick video rundown, see [https://vimeo.com/178485416](https://vimeo.com/178485416).

For background, visit the [official introduction](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html).

For this assignment, I want you to do the following.

1. Create a new R Markdown Document (call it week2.rmd or whatever you want).
2. Using full markdown functionality, make a good looking report about what R lesson's you've completed this week and a brief summary of what you've learned. You must:
i. Break it up into sections using appropriate headers
ii. You must include markdown text and documentation alongside the code.
iii. You do not need to do need to attempt to reach 100% coverage of all the R you've done this week, but make sure you get the feel for how these Markdown documents work.
iv. When you are done, export your report to PDF and upload it to OAKS.
