## Paul Anderson, Principal Investigator
Associate Professor<br>
Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering<br>
California Polytechnic State University<br>
Lead Data Scientist, <a href="https://www.ceterus.com/">Ceterus</a>

Dr. Paul Anderson graduated in 2004 from Wright State University with a B.S. degree in Computer Engineering. He received his Master of Computer Science in 2006 and his Ph.D. in Computer Science & Engineering in June 2010. After graduation, Dr. Anderson was awarded a Consortium of Universities Research Fellowship to study as a Bioinformatics and Computational Research Scientist for the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). Dr. Anderson has published peer-reviewed articles in the fields of data science, data mining, machine learning, computational intelligence, metabolomics, genomics, e-Science, bioinformatics, cloud computing, biomedical informatics, cancer informatics, and computer science & engineering education.

Dr. Anderson is an associate professor in the Computer Science and Software Engineering Department at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly). He has served as the director of the first B.S. in Data Science in the country at the College of Charleston where is also developed the first M.S. in Data Science and Analytics in South Carolina. Dr. Anderson directs the Data Science Research Group at Cal Poly where his team specializes in developing and applying data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to the fields of bioinformatics, genomics, biomedical informatics, and metabolomics. Dr. Anderson’s lab is interested in the foundations of data science with a current focus on machine learning, explainable ranking algorithms, and the rankability of data. He currently has multidisciplinary projects underway in genomics, metabolomics, toxicology, marine biology, cancer informatics, biomedicine, and genomics. Dr. Anderson is the co-director Bioinformatics Research Group (http://lab.birg.dev) and the Bioinformatics and Applied Data Science Core within the Center for Applications in Biotechnology (https://cab.calpoly.edu/).
