### Institute of Graph Analytics, Rankability, and Data Science
The institute or IGARDS - located in the beautiful Harbor Walk facilities of the College of Charleston - has a three-part vision for the foundations of data science: a problem-driven focus, a strong interaction between theory and practice, and deliberate, balanced training of the data science team. Our institute's goals are: (1) to advance research on the rankability problem and its related graph analytics problems, (2) to train faculty, sharing our vision for the conduct of foundational data science work, and (3) to develop a list of skills for data scientists at each educational level (B.S., M.S., Ph.D.) and provide training tutorials for infusing foundational skills into existing and new curricula.

The first foundational research problem of interest is rankability, which refers to a dataset's ability to produce a meaningful ranking of its items. A ranking is a list of items from most to least important. Ranking is a fundamental and underappreciated data science task that permeates almost every aspect of translating computational and algorithmic results into a form that a human can use. Its applications are numerous and include web search, cybersecurity, machine learning, and statistical learning theory.
Minimal attention has been paid to the question of whether a data set is suitable for ranking. Most consumers apply a ranking method without asking questions such as: Can this ranking be  trusted? Are parts of the ranking too similar to be disambiguated and possibly meaningless? How can rankability be quantified? Can rankable subgraphs be identified? At what point is a dynamic, time-evolving graph rankable?
