excerpt: 'We research and develop algorithms to tackle some of the most challenging applied and foundational problems in data science. In our applied work, we specialize in solving data intensive problems in the life sciences (e.g., genomics, metabolomics, bioinformatics, biomedical information). This is reinforced by our passion for studying problems of interest to the general data science community. This revolves around our work on rankability, explainable ranking algorithms, active learning to rank, and more broadly machine learning and evolutionary algorithms.'
