# Deadlines
It is important to have consistent locations for deadlines. For this class, we will
not be using Canvas other than as a mechanism to provide secure grading feedback. Canvas
may also be used to post passwords, etc. This page describes where to look for certain deadlines.

**Disclaimer:** This page is manually updated, so please check the last updated date.

## GitHub Classroom Deadlines (Labs, etc)
Please see GitHub classroom for suggested deadlines for labs. Please see the syllabus for any questions regarding
lab due dates.
