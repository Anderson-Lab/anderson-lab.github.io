# Project
This page contains further details for the menu of projects available to students. Projects are to be worked on all quarter. Your project
must demonstrate mastery of the course learning outcomes to receive full marks. The official course learning outcomes are as follows:
1. Know the main problems in the field of bioinformatics and computational molecular biology.
2. Understand the key algorithms used to solve computational biology and bioinformatics problems
3. Model computational biology problems
4. Apply algorithmic techniques to solve problems in computational biology and bioinformatics
5. Gain experience working on software projects on multidisciplinary teams.

We have arranged a menu based project for you. Meaning you may choose one but not more than one of the following options.
All projects are student centered and student driven. We are not assigning or pushing structure upon you. Mastery is only achieved
on the project by taking ownership of your learning through knowledge creation.

## FAQ
1. Do we have to work in a group? - Working in a group is required to demonstrate mastery of student learning outcome #5.
2. Can I switch my project? - Yes, but the exception is project option C, which requires instructor approval. No approval will be
considered after week 3 ends. You are always free to move from option A to B and back. At the end of the quarter, your official grade
will only be for one project though, so switching will make more work for yourself.
3. Can my group post a single update? No. It's important for everyone to have a chance to represent the progress in their own words. Of course you can share whatever makes sense in terms of preparing, but the actual video must be individual.

## Project Option A
Large group based COVID19 bioinformatics research project. Students opting for this option will function as a
team trying to understand COVID19 from a bioinformatics perspective. Students from the spring have started on this project, and it will
be your task to refine, extend, pivot, move their work forward. This project has probably the least structure. It is of course also one of the
most exciting as you will be pushing into research territory. The goal is to publish this work.

## Project Option B
Make accessible tutorial(s) related to topics discussed in class. There is no better way to show mastery of a topic by teaching
it to someone else. In this case, you'll be asked to create self-driven tutorials and materials. They must be originals.

## Project Option C
Choose your own adventure. You may have an ongoing project that can fit this category. You may seek project suggestions from
your instructors. The one rule for this option is it must be approved by the end of Week 3.

## Grading
For this project, we will have one "bean counting" exercise. Your group must post on Flipgrid once a week. This regular posting is worth 5% out of the total 25% of the project.

Apart from that accountability bean counting exercise, we won't be bean counting. Instead, we will provide you with two preliminary grades (not binding) based on your project. In order to receive this feedback you must submit your work and artifacts AND a mapping from this work to the learning outcomes above. To get the remaining 20%, you must show evidence that your project supports a mastery of each learning outcome.
