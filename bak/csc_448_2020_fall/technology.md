# Coding Environment
I have setup an environment for this class on AWS. You may find information <a href="/csc_448_2020_fall/private.html">here</a>.

You are of course welcome to build your own coding environment with dependencies, etc. I will always help
if time permits, as it is important to learn how to setup your own. But... that is not a learning objective of
this course.

# GitHub classroom
We will use GitHub classroom to manage all turn in procedures. Links to assignments will be provided on the schedule.

# Slack and Canvas
We will use both Slack and Canvas. Please check Canvas and your Cal Poly email for high priority announcements and official grades. Slack is a better platform for more frequent and casual communication.
