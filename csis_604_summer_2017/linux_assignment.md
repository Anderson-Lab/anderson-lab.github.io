This is not a course about linux the command line, but we will need enough knowledge of many things in order to study distributed systems. Some of you may already know enough command line, but for many of you this is new. I've selected a relatively straightforward and brief introduction for everyone. If you need more help, there are several links at the end of this tutorial for you to dig into. If you are a command line wizard, feel free to skip the tutorial and answer the questions below.
