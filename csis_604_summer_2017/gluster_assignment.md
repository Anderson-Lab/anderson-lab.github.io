In this assignment, we will install and configure the Gluster File System. In gluster there is no master node or management node. Every node can be a server and/or a client. As you've seen in the papers, there are alternatives (Ceph, etc), but after hours of errors that seem to be bugs in ceph-deploy according to the interwebs, I've decided to have you work with Gluster instead. If anyone can get Ceph to work and puts together a tutorial, feel free to submit it to the Dropbox for Gluster on OAKS, and I'll award bonus points. But a word of caution that this might be a deep rabbit hole or a quick fix. No way for me to tell at this point. Anyways... Let's get back to Gluster, which works great.
