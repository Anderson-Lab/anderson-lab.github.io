# Project
## Step 1 (Form your group)
* Due: Completed by end of lab on Tuesday, 2/18
* Form a group of 2-3 students (no individual projects allowed)
* <a href="https://classroom.github.com/g/NCLnE38D">Form your team and register here</a>


## Step 2 (Pick either a Knowledge Discovery Project or Implementation Knowledge Discovery Project)
* Due: Completed by end of lab on Tuesday, 2/18
* Knowledge Discovery Projects Overview: Find 2+ datasets, formulate questions of interest, apply algorithms from and related to this course (can be implemented by yourself or KDD libraries), synthesize the results in the form of answers to your questions. This is good for folks who care more about the story that the data can tell us.
* Knowledge Discovery Implementation Projects Overview: Implement 3+ algorithms to implement and demonstrate them on 2+ datasets. This is good for folks who care more about the details and story that each algorithm allows us to tell.

## Step 3 (Formulate a project proposal)
* Weight: 10% of your project grade
* Due: By the start of lab on Tuesday , 2/25
* This will be a presentation during lab to your fellow classmates.
* Exact time for each presentation to be determined based on number of groups
* Slides must be Google Slides and a link must be in your README.md file of your repo.
* If your presentation is not approved, then you will get a 0% until it is approved (more info on this in class).

## Step 4 (Progress every week)
* Weight: 60% of your project grade
* Each team member must prepare a detailed explanation of their activities each week (always due before lab on Tuesday unless other wise stated). This must be in the form a markdown file in the repo with your name associated with it.

## Step 5 (Final presentation)
* Weight: 15% of your project grade
* Each team will make a final presentation that will be graded for quality and clarity
* Given during final exam time

## Step 6 (Final report)
* Weight: 15% of your project grade
* Each team will submit a final project report (ipynb format) (and associated code)
* Graded based on technical quality, presentation, and readability.
