## Course Description
Overview of modern knowledge discovery from data (KDD) methods and technologies. Topics in data mining (association rules mining, classification, clustering), information retrieval, web mining. Emphasis on use of KDD techniques in modern software applications. 3 lectures, 1 laboratory.

## Course Prerequisites
CSC 349 and one of the following: STAT 302, STAT 312, STAT 321 or STAT 350.

## Course Learning Objectives
1. recognize different types of KDD procedures and identify their uses

2. implement algorithms/methods/techniques for KDD tasks to solve KDD problems

3. interpret and analyze the results of KDD processes

4. recognize and evaluate societal impact of KDD technology, make in-formed choices about use of KDD technology

## Textbook and Other Material
Machine learning is a large component of modern KDD, and the machine learning specific content is this course is supported by the textbook "Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective (2nd edition)" by Stephen Marsland, published by CRC Press, part of the Taylor and Francis group.

<a href="/csc_466_2020_winter/CF_AdaptiveWeb_2006.pdf">The topic of collaborative filtering will be supported by this manuscript.</a>

<a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/graph-algorithms/9781492047674/">The topics of graph algorithms and page rank will be supported by this free online book (Cal Poly login required)</a>

## Grading
Labs: 30% (Due the following week unless otherwise specified)

Exams: 50% (Two exams at 25% each)

Project: 10% (Assigned after classification and clustering)

Reflections: 5% (Requested throughout the quarter through Google Forms)

Participation: 5% (Measured via pop quizzes given randomly in lecture or lab)

## Attendance
Attendance will not be recorded each class. Attendance is reflected in your grade by
completing the pop quizzes, which will be graded for effort.

## Late Policy
No late days will be allowed.

## Feedback and Assessment
My goal is to have lab feedback provided to students each week on the prior week's labs.

Feedback on pop quizzes will be obtained immediately through discussion.

Feedback on the project will be available for pickup after the quarter is completed.

Feedback on the exams will be provided within a week from completing the exams.

## Electronics Policy
I strongly encourage you to NOT use electronics in the classroom during lecture.
This includes phones, laptops and tablets.  If you have a good
educational reason for using an electronic device during lecture, please
see me. For more information start with <a href="https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/Using-Electronic-Devices-in-Class">https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/Using-Electronic-Devices-in-Class</a>.

## Grading Scale
Grading Scale: A: 90-100; B: 80-89; C: 70-79; F: <70. Plusses and minuses will be used at the discretion of the instructor.

## Honor Code
Lying, cheating, attempted cheating, and plagiarism are violations of our Honor Code that, when identified, are investigated. Each instance is examined to determine the degree of deception involved.

Incidents where the professor believes the student’s actions are clearly related more to ignorance, miscommunication, or uncertainty, can be addressed by consultation with the student. We will craft a written resolution designed to help prevent the student from repeating the error in the future. The resolution, submitted by form and signed by both the professor and the student, is forwarded to the Dean of Students and remains on file.

Cases of suspected academic dishonesty will be reported directly to the Dean of Students. A student found responsible for academic dishonesty will receive a XF in the course, indicating failure of the course due to academic dishonesty. This grade will appear on the student’s transcript for two years after which the student may petition for the X to be expunged. The student may also be placed on disciplinary probation, suspended (temporary removal) or expelled (permanent removal) from the College by the Honor Board.

It is important for students to remember that unauthorized collaboration--working together without permission-- is a form of cheating. Unless a professor specifies that students can work together on an assignment and/or test, no collaboration is permitted. Other forms of cheating include possessing or using an unauthorized study aid (such as a PDA), copying from another’s exam, fabricating data, and giving unauthorized assistance.

Remember, research conducted and/or papers written for other classes cannot be used in whole or in part for any assignment in this class without obtaining prior permission from the professor.

## Diversity Statement (Cal Poly official statement)
At Cal Poly we believe that academic freedom, a cornerstone value, is exercised best when there is understanding and respect for our diversity of experiences, identities, and world views. Consequently, we create learning environments that allow for meaningful development of self-awareness, knowledge, and skills alongside attention to others who may have experiences, worldviews, and values that are different from our own. In so doing, we encourage our students, faculty, and staff to seek out opportunities to engage with others who are both similar and different from them, thereby increasing their capacity for knowledge, empathy, and conscious participation in local and global communities.

In the spirit of educational equity, and in acknowledgement of the significant ways in which a university education can transform the lives of individuals and communities, we strive to increase the diversity at Cal Poly. As an institution that serves the state of California within a global context, we support the recruitment, retention, and success of talented students, faculty, and staff from across all societies, including people who are from historically and societally marginalized and underrepresented groups.

Cal Poly is an inclusive community that embraces differences in people and thoughts. By being open to new ideas and showing respect for diverse points of view, we support a climate that allows all students, faculty, and staff to feel valued, which in turn facilitates the recruitment and retention of a diverse campus population. We are a culturally invested university whose members take personal responsibility for fostering excellence in our own and others’ endeavors. To this end, we support an increased awareness and understanding of how one’s own identity facets (such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, social class, and nation of origin) and the combinations of these identities and experiences that may accompany them can affect our different worldviews.

## Disability Accomodations
Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact me individually to discuss your specific needs. Also, please contact the Disability Resource Center: [https://drc.calpoly.edu/content/drc-services](https://drc.calpoly.edu/content/drc-services).
