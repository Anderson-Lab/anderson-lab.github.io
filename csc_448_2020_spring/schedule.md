# Schedule
I cannot stress enough that consideration is available for any health or
extenuating circumstance that you experience this quarter. Please reach out to me
at any time for any reason. Consideration includes but is not limited to individually
modified due dates. In other words, do not let this course take priority over your health.

We will be using a hybrid asynchronous/synchronous model this semester.
To be more specific, the weekly labs and assignments are to be completed individually and asynchronously.
I will be designing these labs to be automatically graded. Students are encouraged to post anything other than direct solutions (and of course appropriate material).
The due dates for asynchronous activities are strict. If you fall behind for health or other pandemic related
concerns please reach out to me. Otherwise, I have to keep the deadlines strict so that the material can build
on each week.

I want to say a few words about my world. Monday is honestly my best day for generating new material, lectures, meetings, etc.
I am the primary caregiver for my three small children Tuesday-Friday as my wife is in pediatrics, and she is needed during this pandemic.
This does not mean I won't be prioritizing this course. It just means that life is crazy and weird and random Tuesday-Friday. It also means
that I have a lot to cram into Monday. If we support one another during this time, I honestly believe we
can grow our humanity during this challenging time. Throughout the quarter you'll definitely get a glimpse of my day-to-day world.

**How did we pick the order on the schedule?** I have endeavored to pick an order that will allow us to approach the data analysis
needed during this pandemic. As such, it skips around a lot, and when necessary we'll have to
fill in material from previous chapters on the fly. Most of each chapter stands alone, but not all.

Below is our tentative schedule. It is subject to change, but any changes will be reflected here.
